# Comparative-Analysis-of-Multi-Layer-Perceptron-Classifiers-on-MNIST-Dataset
This project aims to evaluate the performance of different Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers on the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits. The goal is to compare models with varying hidden layer sizes to assess their classification accuracy.

##Project Overview
The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in machine learning, containing 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). In this project, three different MLP classifiers with varying numbers of hidden layers are used to classify these digits. The performance of each model is evaluated using various metrics.

##Requirements
Python 3.x
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn

##You can install the required packages using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

##Run the Code:

Execute the script in a Python environment where the required packages are installed.
Understand Results:
Review the confusion matrices and classification reports to compare the performance of the models.

##Results
Confusion Matrices: Display the performance of each model in terms of true positives, false positives, etc.
Classification Reports: Provide precision, recall, and F1-score for each digit class.
